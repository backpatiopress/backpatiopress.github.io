<h3 id="about">Hello</h3>
<i>"Back Patio is consistently delivering the good shit"</i> - Popscure
<br><br>
<p>Back Patio Press is a small, DIY press that focuses on weird writing outside the purview of established literary publishing. The press was founded in 2019 by Cavin B. Gonzalez, with an accompanying literary magazine. We published 10 books before taking a hiatus ~2022-2023 , but have recently reopened to focus just on publishing books. The press is currently run by <a href="https://zacsmith.net" target="_blank">Zac Smith</a>. We are not entirely sure who rums the twitter account.
<br><br>
We publish slim volumes of poetry and literary fiction, typically by debut authors. We work directly with authors, customers, and, sometimes, book stores. No agents, distributors, or PR companies. We stock and ship orders made through Flat Dog Distro by hand, but we also use Amazon KDP print-on-demand services for expanded distribution for most of our books. Our titles typically sell between 20 and 300 copies during their initial runs.</p>

<p><b><i>Liver Mush</i> by Graham Irvin</b><br>
<i>Poetry / 134 Pages / Soft, glossy cover</i><br>

<i>Liver Mush</i> is a book about liver mush. Liver mush is a pork liver and cornmeal based food eaten mostly for breakfast and mostly in Western North Carolina. Liver mush is a hard sell because most people don't want to eat liver and most people question meat called mush. Liver Mush is a collection of stories and poems based on the conflict of bad sounding things being good. Good seeming things being bad. Most things being unidentifiable. Memory being blurry and vague. Home being slathered on a biscuit. Home being a cat named Bambi. 'Liver Mush' is a book for people who feel bad after eating too much but keep on eating. It's a question that doesn't matter and an answer that does:

Yes, I want some liver mush.

<br><br><i>"I enjoyed Liver Mushâ€”a fun, funny, playful, original, food-heavy, Bambi-including book of poems and prose."
</i>-Tao Lin<br><br>

<p><b><i>Good at Drugs</i> by KKUURRTT</b><br>
<i>Novel / 242 Pages / Soft, glossy cover</i><br>

The last American music festival. Psychedelics, nose drugs, and house music. Except this time something feels different. Not sure what? End of the world? Drug-induced conspiracy? Nah. An adventure in the mind of an adventurous mind. Tripping, rolling, and dissociating through the musical and/or pharmacological ropes course that is a three day music festival.
<br><br>
<i>"Good At Drugs is a garrulous book full of despicable characters, unabashed heathenism and the nearly unintelligible ramblings of a degenerate drug abuser on the cusp of a midlife crisis. In short I wish I had the talent and experience to write a novel as pure and beautiful myself."</i> - Steve Anwyll, author of <i>Welfare</i><br><br>

<p><b><i>A Completely Nonexistent Carnival</i> by Cavin Gonzalez</b><br>
<i>Poetry / 131 Pages / Soft, matte cover</i><br>

 He refuses to leave his house. The ramen boxes are piling up. Bong water seeps into the floors. He has forgotten how it feels to touch another person. Paranoia peaks as reality dissolves, as eyes turn to shredded gelatin and we are consumed whole by the shadow of every person who has ever lived. Rats dance about the living room. The TV has gone static. His brain has gone static. The medicine has stopped working. And, if you listen closely, you can hear the carnival music leaking from his ears and mouth.

<p><b><i>Watertown</i> by Dan Eastman</b><br>
<i>Poetry / 109 Pages / Soft, matte cover</i><br>

Watertown is a book of poems about traffic accidents, dive bars, drunk dads, Wrestlemania XIV, peanut butter sandwiches, piss stains in the snow, first kisses, and those little trees that dangle from your rear view mirror as you slip over black ice on the way to your minimum wage job. It's a nostalgia trip for people who hate nostalgia trips. It's about loving something that will never love you back. It's a place somewhere upstate. It's Watertown.

<p><b><i>Numbskull</i> by No Glykon</b><br>
<i>Novel / 130 Pages / Soft, matte cover</i><br>

 Numbskull is a cat-type thing. Itâ€™s a safe word for having serious conversations. Itâ€™s graffiti scrawled on a broken speaker. Framed by No Glykonâ€™s fine-tuned minimalism, Numbskullis a hazy shot tracking youth in decay: four f**kheads flickering through basement noise shows, the gun aisle in Walmart, internships out in Endless Summer, and trepidatious texts about maybe getting some drinks tomorrow night. Everything in Numbskull is a little blurry or out of focus or whatever. So go ahead and tear up your clothes for fashion. Grow some golden antlers. Put an apple on your head and let 'Numbskull' pull the trigger.
<br><br>
<i>"Numbskull is like the dream you have after getting high and staring at the sun for too long, a dream you don't want to wake up from. It's populated by people you know and people you want to. Its images slot into the folds of your brain and stay there... You will want to read Numbskull on an endless loop, like leaving a song on repeat until it becomes part of the texture of your life."</i> -- Cassandra de Alba, author of Ugly/Sad

<p><b><i>Venice</i> by T. J. Larkey</b><br>
<i>Novel / 168 Pages / Soft, matte cover</i><br>

 Ty has escaped to Los Angeles. Stuck in a cycle of wandering the boardwalk in search of a dealer and attending group interviews for minimum-wage jobs, Ty soon finds himself even more broke than before. Can he get it together? Ideally, maybe. That might be a stretch, though. Told through the dry nonchalance of an American everyman, T.J. Larkey weaves a darkly funny adventure full of isolation, self destruction, and breaking bread with a mouse.

<i>Short stories / 100 Pages / Soft, matte cover</i><br>

 These are the confessions of a stagnant college graduate seeking solace from his invasive thoughts and the Floridian-Hellscape written in the form of short stories, poems, and everything in-between. Take a tour around a neighborhood plagued by the presence of a young hermit struggling with a gas station hot dog diet, an evil twin, obnoxious neighbors, elves, and the ever present whispers from inside his noggin urging him toward self destruction.

<p><b><i>Photographs of Madness</i> by Alec Ivan Fugate</b><br>
<i>Novella / 107 Pages / Soft, matte cover</i><br>

There exists an apartment that omits a warm and comfortable smell. Many have lived in it. All have gone missing, met a form of madness in that wicked place. Photographs of Madness: Inside Out is a poetically styled flash fiction collection composed of four parts. Each section spans years between the last, linking each of the four unique character through the horrors they experienced in their cursed lives. Observe as the larger sickness at hand unfolds, dare to unveil the secrets behind that secret, damp door that reeks of cardamon pods. Using an abstract writing style and unique typesetting, Fugate showcases rapid mental decline and surreal imagery in this emotionally provocative and unnerving work.
<br><br>
<i>"Itâ€™s the kind of text that is imbued with all of the best stuff: hidden meanings, implied silences and phantasmagorical imagery. The use of repetition here is fastidious and honestly, astounding. This is real workâ€” work that reads like it was translated meticulously, without losing or sacrificing any of the heart."</i> - Mike Kleine, author of Kanley Stubrick
